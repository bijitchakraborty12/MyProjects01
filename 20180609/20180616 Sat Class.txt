DRY - Dont Repeat Yourself		--> Recommended
WET - Write Everything Twice		--> NOT Recommended

templating
----------
this helps in being DRY in coding
 
Use templating as much as possible so that you can abstract out the more common portions of your strings and you are able to write as DRY code as possible.

DRY code helps in better maintenence

-> Collection - a collection of items or objects on which a loop can be run (all Data structures and Strings are Collections)
   
-> Sequence - is a collection which preserves it's order (List, Set and Tuple are Sequences)


Data Structures
---------------
Why DS?
------
 - Storage
 - Retrieval
 - Transformation
 

TYPES IF DATA STRUCTURES:
-------------------------
1. LIST - is a Sequence
   
   -It be can a collection of any number of similar or dissimillar objects or values-
   - Every item in a list also containsa pointer to the next item
   - It's implementation is simmillar to a Linked List
   - It is mutable

2. DICTIONARY
   - it is a collection of items stored in a key-value paired fashion       
   - it is MUTABLE
 
3. SET - is a sequence 
   - it is the implementation of mathematical concept of Sets
   - Thus, the set operations can be performed on these
   - It should contain only UNIQUE values
   - MUTABLE

4. TUPLE - is a sequence
   - it is a collection of UNIQUE items
   - it is IMMUTABLE
   - Thus, once defined, it cannot be altered
   - an use case of this can be to write configurations


1. LIST
--------
creating a list: 

x=[1,2,3]
b=[1,{'b',2},3]

Note: an array is a contiguous (i.e., clubbed together in a serial fashion) blocks of memory
Python also suports arrays, but is not very frequently used. Lists are ebough
 

2. DICTIONARY
-------------
    - Example:
      x={'name':'bijit','address':'marathahalli}
    - The keys should be unique, but values could be repititive
 
3. SET
------
    - Example:
      x={1,2,3}

4. TUPLE
--------
    - Example:
      x=(1,2,3)
